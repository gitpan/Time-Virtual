year 2000K testing?  :)

hook into Time::HiRes

How to cope with sleep/select/poll when time is going faster/slower
than normal?

Time::Adjustible
  inc/dec the speed of time
  restart time at a specific time

Time::DayRelative
  resets to zero at midnight

@EXPORT_OK = qw(broadcast_adjustment subscribe unsubscribe)??
