=head1 NAME

Time::Virtual - Publish high-precision time or custom implementations of time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  require Time::Virtual;

  # XXX add example

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a mechanism to insert a level of indirection
between the actually hardware-level time and the time as seen by the
current process.

Effort is made to avoid any assumptions about how time is represented
and what is the available precision.

There is also a C-API available in order to allow customizing the
passage of time.  (Speed up, slow down, time travel, etc.)
